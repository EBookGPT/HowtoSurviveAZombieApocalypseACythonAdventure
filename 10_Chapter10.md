# Chapter 10: Escaping a City and Starting Anew in The Wilderness

In the previous chapter, you learned how to thrive in a post-apocalyptic world. However, in some cases, staying put is not always the best option. Cities can be overrun, supplies can become scarce, and safety can become a luxury. When faced with these circumstances, it is essential to know when and how to escape.

In this chapter, we will discuss the importance of leaving an overrun city and moving towards a quieter location where you can start anew. The wilderness can provide safety and ample resources for those who are prepared. We will go through the basic steps of finding a new location and how to start again from scratch.

You will be faced with many new challenges, but with the knowledge and skills you have gained from the previous chapters, you will be able to survive and thrive. It's time to leave the chaos of the city behind and venture into the wilderness. The thrilling possibilities of a new start await!
# Chapter 10: Escaping a City and Starting Anew in The Wilderness

## The Tale of Dracula's Escape

As you take your first steps out of the destroyed city, you sense a familiar presence. Suddenly, a dark figure approaches you from the shadows.

"I see that you have decided to follow my example and escape the clutches of the undead," the figure says.

You recognize the figure as Dracula, the legendary vampire. He proceeds to tell you his story.

"I once lived in a grand castle, surrounded by the undead. But when the zombie apocalypse came, I knew I had to leave. I packed the essentials and fled to the wilderness. There, I found a cave that could double as my lair. It took time to adjust, but being away from the chaos of the city proved to be worth it. The wilderness provided me with food, water, and, most importantly, safety."

Dracula grins as he sees the doubt in your eyes.

"You may not believe that I, a vampire, have survived this long, but I assure you, the wilderness is your best bet. The key is to plan and prepare well."

He tells you of the dangers that lie in wait in the wilderness, from wild animals to harsh weather conditions. But with the right skills and resources, you can overcome them.

Dracula hands you a map with a marked location, and you thank him for his advice. You set off towards the wilderness, ready to start anew.

## The Cython Code

The first step in starting anew in the wilderness is to find a suitable location. You decide to use Dracula's advice and use your coding skills to find the perfect spot. 

Using Cython, you create a function to scan the area and select a location that meets specific criteria such as close proximity to water, food sources, and defensibility.

```python
import cython

@cython.boundscheck(False)
cdef locate_wilderness():
    cdef list wilderness = []
    for x in range(100):
        for y in range(100):
            if scan_area(x,y) == 'water' and food_source(x,y) and defensible_position(x,y):
                wilderness.append((x,y))
    return wilderness

def scan_area(int x, int y):
    #code to scan for water

def food_source(int x, int y):
    #code to check for edible plants and animals

def defensible_position(int x, int y):
    #code to determine the area's defensibility
```

After running the locate_wilderness function, you have found your new home. The wilderness provides you with everything you need to survive and thrive, just as it did for Dracula.

With Dracula's advice and your coding skills, you are ready to escape the city and start anew in the wilderness. Who knows what new challenges await you, but armed with your knowledge, you are ready to face them head-on.
The code used to resolve the Dracula story is a Python function written in Cython. The function `locate_wilderness()` scans the area and selects a location that meets specific criteria such as close proximity to water, food sources, and defensibility. 

The `@cython.boundscheck(False)` decorator tells Cython not to perform bounds-checking on the list of wilderness locations. This can improve the speed of the function. 

The `scan_area()` function is called with the x and y coordinates of each point in the area, and it returns the type of terrain at that location. The `food_source()` function checks if there are any edible plants or animals in the area. Finally, the `defensible_position()` function determines if the location is easily defensible.

The `locate_wilderness()` function uses a nested loop to check each point in the area. If a point meets all the criteria, it is added to the `wilderness` list. After the loops have completed, the function returns the `wilderness` list of locations.

By using this function, the code is able to find a suitable location in the wilderness that meets the necessary criteria for survival. This demonstrates the importance of coding skills in a post-apocalyptic world, as they can be used to help you find the resources and shelter that you need to survive.
